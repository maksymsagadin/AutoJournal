# AutoJournal

Welcome to AutoJournal, a vehicle maintenance tracking application. This application is designed to help vehicle owners keep track of their vehicle's maintenance tasks and expenses in a simple and efficient way. 

## About the Project

AutoJournal is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. 

For data storage, we use MongoDB, a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. It allows us to store our data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

User authentication is handled by NextAuth, a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It is designed from the ground up to support Next.js and Serverless.

The user interface is built using Material-UI, a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design.
